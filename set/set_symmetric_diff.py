# **Question:**  
# A company maintains two sets of employee IDs:  
# Set 1: `{1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005}`  
# Set 2: `{1003, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007}`  
# Find the symmetric difference between these two sets. What will be the result?  

# **Expected Output:**  
# `{1001, 1002, 1006, 1007}`  

Set_1= {1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005}  
Set_2= {1003, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007} 
# result = Set_1 ^ Set_2
result = Set_1.symmetric_difference(Set_2)
print (result)
